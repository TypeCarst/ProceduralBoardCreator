# Procedural Board Creator
The BoardCreator is a Unity project for initializing a 3D game board with x*y tiles (e.g. a chess board), where each tile can also hold a height value. 

Possible additions:
- tile scaling based on a matrix, e.g. a noise map
- presets for board layouts
- colouring of the tiles based on height (height map, heat map)
- automatic noise generation considering height difference between neighbouring tiles (if wished by user)
- path finding in a noise map and optimizing the map regarding the found path
- "ingame" editor with export function
